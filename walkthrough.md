# Walkthrough — UI/UX, Responsiveness & Stability Enhancements

The **AI-Driven Industrial Approval & Compliance Management Platform (MahaClearance Gateway)** has been comprehensively upgraded with an enterprise government SaaS design system, responsive navigation, dedicated sub-pages, global search, and smooth workflows for an SIH hackathon demonstration.

---

## 1. Global Design System & UI Primitives

- **Design System**: Replaced inconsistent card designs and gradients with a restrained government enterprise palette (Navy/Slate, Indigo/Sky, Emerald for Valid/Approved, Amber for Queries/Expiring, Rose for Missing/Overdue).
- **Reusable Primitives** (`frontend/src/components/ui/`):
  - [`Modal.jsx`](file:///c:/Users/SHREE/Desktop/new%20project/frontend/src/components/ui/Modal.jsx): Accessible dialog with outside click dismissal, Escape key handling, and background lock.
  - [`ConfirmDialog.jsx`](file:///c:/Users/SHREE/Desktop/new%20project/frontend/src/components/ui/ConfirmDialog.jsx): Styled confirmation modals with destructive actions.
  - [`Skeleton.jsx`](file:///c:/Users/SHREE/Desktop/new%20project/frontend/src/components/ui/Skeleton.jsx): Smooth card, table row, and text shimmer loaders.
  - [`EmptyState.jsx`](file:///c:/Users/SHREE/Desktop/new%20project/frontend/src/components/ui/EmptyState.jsx): Standardized empty state with icon, guidance, and primary action button.
  - [`ProgressBar.jsx`](file:///c:/Users/SHREE/Desktop/new%20project/frontend/src/components/ui/ProgressBar.jsx): Color-coded accessible progress bar.
  - [`PageHeader.jsx`](file:///c:/Users/SHREE/Desktop/new%20project/frontend/src/components/ui/PageHeader.jsx): Standardized headers with breadcrumbs and action buttons.
  - [`ToastContext.jsx`](file:///c:/Users/SHREE/Desktop/new%20project/frontend/src/context/ToastContext.jsx): Global toast notification system (`toast.success()`, `toast.error()`, `toast.warning()`).

## 2. Navigation, Header & Sidebar Restructuring

### Sidebar (`Sidebar.jsx`)
- **Three Persona Navigations**:
  - **Entrepreneur**: Dashboard, Business Profile, Find Approvals, My Approvals, Document Vault, Document Planner, My Applications, Inspections, Renewals, Recommended Schemes, Grievances, AI Assistant.
  - **Officer**: Dashboard, Applications, Queries, Inspections, Notifications, AI Assistant.
  - **Admin**: Dashboard, Users, Businesses, Approvals, Knowledge Base, Applications, Analytics, Grievances, Audit Logs.
- **Desktop Collapse Toggle**: Toggle between full expanded view and collapsed icon-only view.
- **Responsive Mobile Drawer**: Sidebar slides in as a mobile drawer with backdrop and **automatically closes when any nav item is clicked**.

### Top Header (`Navbar.jsx`)
- Compact **`● DEMO MODE`** badge: Replaced giant top banner with a sleek header pill that opens an informational modal explaining the demo regulatory data.
- **1-Click Demo Role Switcher**: Segmented dropdown (`Entrepreneur | Officer | Admin`) that instantly updates authentication tokens, loads the corresponding dashboard, and preserves demo data.
- **Global Search (`Ctrl+K`)**: [`GlobalSearchModal.jsx`](file:///c:/Users/SHREE/Desktop/new%20project/frontend/src/components/GlobalSearchModal.jsx) enables instant searching across approvals, filings, vault documents, and regulatory acts.

## 6. Entrepreneur Regulatory Roadmap (Compliance Journey)

A dedicated, additive regulatory roadmap module showing the entrepreneur the entire end-to-end compliance journey from foundational entity setup to post-approval operations in required dependency order.

### Features & Implementation
1. **Backend Models & Data** ([`roadmap.py`](file:///c:/Users/SHREE/Desktop/new%20project/backend/app/models/roadmap.py)):
   - `RoadmapStep`: 11 standardized statutory steps with code, category (`FOUNDATIONAL`, `SECTOR_SPECIFIC`, `POST_APPROVAL`), plain-language description, issuing authority, official portal URL, SLA days, government fee schedule, and dependency codes.
   - `BusinessRoadmapStatus`: Tracks status (`NOT_STARTED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `DONE`), completion timestamp, reference number (PAN, Udyam No, GSTIN, etc.), and applicant notes per business.
2. **11 Ordered Dependency Steps**:
   1. `PAN`: Permanent Account Number (Income Tax Dept, 7–15 days, ₹100–110, `incometax.gov.in`)
   2. `INCORPORATION`: Partnership Deed / MCA Incorporation (MCA/Sub-Registrar, 7–20 days, ₹0–2,000, `mca.gov.in`) — depends on `PAN`
   3. `UDYAM`: Udyam MSME Registration (MoMSME, same day, Free ₹0, `udyamregistration.gov.in`) — depends on `PAN`, `INCORPORATION`
   4. `GST`: GST Registration (CBIC / State GST, 3–7 days, Free ₹0, `gst.gov.in`) — depends on `PAN`, `INCORPORATION`
   5. `SHOP_ACT`: Shop & Establishment / Gumasta (State Labour Dept / Aaple Sarkar, 7–10 days, ₹100–2,500) — depends on `INCORPORATION`
   6. `FACTORY_LICENSE`: Factory Plan Approval (DISH, 30–45 days) — unlocked once `UDYAM` & `GST` are DONE
   7. `FSSAI`: Food Processing Registration/License (FSSAI/FOSCOS, 30–60 days) — unlocked once `UDYAM` & `GST` are DONE
   8. `POLLUTION_CONSENT`: Consent to Establish (State Pollution Control Board - MPCB, 30–60 days) — depends on `UDYAM`, `GST`, `FACTORY_LICENSE`
   9. `FIRE_NOC`: Fire Safety Provisional NOC (State Fire Service, 15–30 days) — depends on `FACTORY_LICENSE`
   10. `TRADE_LICENCE`: Local Municipal Trade License (PMC / NMC / MCGM, 15–20 days) — depends on `SHOP_ACT`, `GST`
   11. `CONSENT_TO_OPERATE`: Consent to Operate / CTO (MPCB, 30–45 days) — locked until `POLLUTION_CONSENT` & `FIRE_NOC` are marked DONE
3. **Dependency Locking Logic** ([`routers/roadmap.py`](file:///c:/Users/SHREE/Desktop/new%20project/backend/app/routers/roadmap.py)):
   - Any step with incomplete dependencies automatically renders as `LOCKED` with an explanation of unmet prerequisites.
   - Once prerequisites are marked `DONE`, the step automatically unlocks to `NOT_STARTED` and can be toggled to `IN_PROGRESS` or `DONE`.
4. **Interactive UI** ([`RegulatoryRoadmap.jsx`](file:///c:/Users/SHREE/Desktop/new%20project/frontend/src/pages/RegulatoryRoadmap.jsx)):
   - Vertical timeline/stepper UI with progress bar (`X of 11 steps completed`).
   - Category filtering: *All (11)*, *Foundational (5)*, *Sector Clearances (5)*, *Post-Approval (1)*.
   - Statutory fee transparency tooltip and disclaimer: *"Approximate government statutory fees only — professional/CA charges not included"*.
   - Direct link: *"Apply on Official Portal ↗"* opening genuine portals in a new tab.
   - In-app clearance link: *"Single Window →"* linking directly to existing `/approvals/{id}` clearance flow.
   - Reference number recording (PAN, GSTIN, Udyam No) with inline edit & save.
5. **Dashboard Integration** ([`Dashboard.jsx`](file:///c:/Users/SHREE/Desktop/new%20project/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx)):
   - Prominent **"YOUR NEXT COMPLIANCE STEP"** card pointing to the earliest unlocked incomplete milestone (e.g. Step 6: Factory Plan Approval).
6. **Sidebar Navigation** ([`Sidebar.jsx`](file:///c:/Users/SHREE/Desktop/new%20project/frontend/src/components/Sidebar.jsx)):
   - Added **"Roadmap"** navigation item for Entrepreneur role positioned directly above "Find Approvals".
